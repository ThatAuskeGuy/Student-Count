# Student-Count
Special Case Student Counting Program

### What is this?
My current employer is a small SaaS provider in the aviation sector. From the beginning, our billing process has been very hands on. Our developers created a basic billing system page for each customer, but the actual process of invoicing has been very hands on. When I joined the company, we had close to 60 customers, and the average total time it would take to complete a billing cycle was about two weeks depending on the month. Since assisting in billing each month is part of my job description, I know how difficult it is to keep track of every different way we bill our customers based on what they asked for in their contracts.

Having completed two previous projects for our billing needs, I needed to create one for special case customers. Very rarely, we have some customers that have figured out how to cheat the billing system. By taking students out of the system every day, they were able to lower the amount they were being invoiced each month.

### How does it work?
In order to get a more accurate amount these special case customers owed us, I developed this program which takes a CSV file of every student's debit account transaction (which is tracked by our flagship product), and based on the number of activities they have completed in the month, then generates a more accurate count of students for that month. After less than a second, the program generates a nicely formatted Excel spreadsheet that we will send out to this customer.

### What's next?
This is a fairly static program. There is hardly anything about it that changes at all. If the CSV file is ever changed, then I will make changes as necessary to keep it updated, but that rarely happens. Since this is for special case customers, it will remain as it is.
